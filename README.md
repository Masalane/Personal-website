This piece of work presents a small microsevices application designed in JavaScript and HTML. It 
strives demonstrate some of software engineering fundamentals and the concept of CI/CD. Presented 
below are the technologies used to built the application. This document also substantiate brief why 
such technologies were used as oppossed to their counters technologies.

Following are the tools used to design and test this application:
    1. Node.js and express framework
    2. Source control - Git
    3. Testing server - Travis CI 
    4. Browser host - microsoft Azure

 Design and architecture decisions
    1. Motive behind using node.js is because it is an open source server-side tool. Knowing that
       open source sofwares are supported by large open source community gives an impression that
       such softwares are maintained and are efficient.

    2. Node.js is a runtime javaScript environment. This influenced use of javaScript to write this
       application.

    3. Travis and git are widely used CI/CD open source tools. This influenced the use of these tools 
       in this assessment. Moreover, they have a relatively strong open source community support.

    4. Use of azure to host the application was genuinly influeced by the fact that it is compatible 
       with Travis and easy to use.
